import { Preview, Props, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'
import Chart from './chart'

# Button

I can embed a story (but not define one, since this file should not contain a `Meta`):

<Preview>
  <Story id="chart-line--basic" />
</Preview>

And I can also embed arbitrary markdown & JSX in this file.

<Props of={Chart} />
